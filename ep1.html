        <P>
          Twenty-two year old Leo Tasara woke up at eight am, like always,  put on some Edvard Grieg, and 
          jumped under the shower.
        </p>

        <p>“It’s gonna be a great day, motherfuckers,” he shouted as he waltzed to the music, creaming himself 
          up with lotion.
        </p>

        <p>A science and society class on the history of computing was to kickstart the morning, followed by an 
          inspiration-finding group field trip to a handful of Berlin’s ceramics stores.

        <p>However, Leo was most excited about lunch. He was to meet up with a friend who had just came back 
          from a “spectacular” exchange semester in Silicon Valley.</p>
          
        <p>“It’s gonna be a wonderful day, man,” Leo repeated.</p>
          
        <p>A few moments later, he was shouting at his neighbour’s door.</p>

        <p>"Amir, dude, are you coming or what?”</p>

        <p>There was no answer. Today was probably one of those days where weed was in and people and school were out.</p>
          
        <p>“If you came all the way from Iran to smoke your life away here, then by all means, man!”</p>

        <p>Finished, Leo walked out into the most bizarre day of his life thus far.</p>
