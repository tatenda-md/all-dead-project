        <P>
            Leo cycled into a quiet morning outside. He was glad to have no pizza delivery motorbikes breathing
             on his neck up the street. When he turned left into Prenzlauer Alley, there was no traffic either. 
             All the shops at the adjacent mall were closed. There was no single soul in sight anywhere.
     </p>

        <p> Leo grew curious. Where on God’s green earth was everyone?

        <p>Was today some crazy German holiday that he wasn’t aware of where everyone simply hid 
            inside their apartments all day like hedgehogs in hibernation?
        </p>
          
        <p>   Two stone throws further, the young man cycled into a wreck. Right there across the intersection lay
            a tram car that had derailed and fell on its side en route to Alexanderplatz.

        <p> A bunch of motor vehicles had subsequently crashed into it as well.           
        </p>

        <p> Leo jumped off to investigate. There were dead people everywhere. Blood. Ruptured guts. Shattered glass.           
        </p>
          
        <p>“Oh my God,” he gasped.            
        </p>

        <p>Was someone going to call a krankenwagen? Were the police on their way yet?          
        </p>

        <p>With a tremble, Leo dialled in for emergency services. No one answered. Something was terribly wrong.
